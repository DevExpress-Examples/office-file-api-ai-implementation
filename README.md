# Office File API â€“ Integrate AI to Generate Accessible Descriptions

The following project integrates AI capabilities into a DevExpress-powered Office File API Web API application. OpenAI API is used to generate descriptions for images in Microsoft Word files and for Excel charts.

> [!note]
> Before you incorporate this solution in your app, please be sure to read and understand OpenAI's license agreement and terms of use.

## Implementation Details

The project uses the [Azure.AI.OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI/) package which adapts OpenAI's REST APIs so it can be used in non-Azure OpenAI development.

The `OpenAIClientImageHelper` class sends a request to describe an image and obtain a string with a response. The `OpenAIClientImageHelper` class methods are executed within corresponding endpoints.

For Excel files, charts are converted to images to obtain a relevant description.
